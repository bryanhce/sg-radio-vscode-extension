## Motivation

Back in the early 2000s growing up in Singapore, there was no Spotify yet. When I was studying for big exams like the PSLE and O-Levels, 
I would always have the radio on in the background. The music and random chatter kept me company and made those long study sessions a little less boring.

I made this extension to bring back those vibes! Just a fun way to relive the good old days. Also, it just so happens to be Singaporeâ€™s 60th birthday... so happy birthday, Singapore!
